# Interact with claim issuers

We provide an implementation of a Claim Issuer in the ONCHAINID repository. It supports signing claims using different
keys and revoking claims. See [the claim issuer interface requirements](./interfaces.mdx#Claim-issuer) for more details
on what functions are mandatory to implement for a Claim Issuer contract. The Claim Issuer we provide is also a full
Identity, able to store claims for its address, and usage of the `execute` and `approve` methods.

## Deployment

Deploying a Claim Issuer using the example contract:

```javascript
const Onchainid = require('@onchain-id/solidity');
const ClaimIssuer = new ethers.ContractFactory(Onchainid.ClaimIssuer.abi, Onchainid.ClaimIssuer.bytecode, signer);
const claimIssuer = await ClaimIssuer.deploy(ownerAddress);
```

From the contract repository, it is also possible to use the convenient script with hardhat (make sure networks are
configured in `hardhat.config.ts`, the claim issuer owner will be the first account defined for the selected network):

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-claim-issuer.ts --network <network>
```

## Issuance of a claim

Issuing a claim does NOT require interaction with the contracts. In the implementation we provide, the signature of the
claim is enough to attest its origin.

To issue a claim, the claim issuer must define the content of the claim, generate the digest of the claim, and sign it
using a key authorized on the contract for CLAIM purpose (purpose `3`) or MANAGEMENT.

The digest of the claim is a keccak256 hash of the subject identity address, claim topic and claim data abi-encoded:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="solidity" label="Solidity" default>
    <CodeBlock language="solidity">
    bytes32 digest = keccak256(abi.encode(identity, topic, data));
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">
    <CodeBlock language="javascript">
    const digest = ethers.utils.keccak256(ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(['address', 'bytes32', 'bytes'], [identity, topic, data]));
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The structure of a claim and the content of data is not enforced. `data` can be:
- A clear text string (JSON stringified, an URL, a word, a sentence, ...).
- The hash of the content of the claim.
- Empty

When `data` contains the hash of the content of the claim, we recommend using the sha256 hash of the properties of the
claim:

```javascript
ethers.utils.sha256(ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify({
  topic,
  emissionDate,
  privateData, // should include a unique random identifier.
  publicData, // should include a unique random identifier.
})));
```

## Revocation of a claim

In the implementation we provide, the claim issuer can revoke a claim by calling the `revokeClaimBySignature` method.
Only a MANAGEMENT key can execute this method.

The revocation is stored by keeping the claim signature in a mapping. This means this signature would never be valid
again. The same claim issuer will never be able to issue the same claim with the same data for the same topic for the
same identity address (because the signature would be identical to the one revoked).

> The method `revokeClaim` by ID has been deprecated, as it depends on the identity contract to return the claim to be
> revoked. This prevents the Claim Issuer from revoking a claim that was not added to an identity contract.

## Verification of a claim status

To verify the validity of a claim, a verifier must call the `isClaimValid` method on the Claim Issuer contract.

> :::danger
>
> Note that the `isClaimValid` method takes the claim `data` as an argument. As with the `addClaim` method, whatever
> information is in the `data`, it will be public. Do NOT store sensitive information in the `data` field of a claim,
> event encrypted. `data` should only include public information or hash of sensitive information, properly salted.
